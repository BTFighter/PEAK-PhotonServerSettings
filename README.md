Without these mods, this wouldn't be possible!

### Information

This mod allows you to override a few values to allow using a custom photon server:

- Photon App IDs & Udp Ports
- Photon Connection Protocol
- Photon Server Address, Port & Version
- Photon Objects In One Update & Send Rate
  - Do not change these unless you are using your own app ids or server. Semiwork have set these to be optimal based on their own testing.
